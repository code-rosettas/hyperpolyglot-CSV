python:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Python blocks begin with a line that ends in a colon. The block ends with the first line that is not indented further than the initial line. Python raises an IndentationError if the statements in the block that are not in a nested block are not all indented the same. Using tabs in Python source code is unrecommended and many editors replace them automatically with spaces. If the Python interpreter encounters a tab, it is treated as 8 spaces.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
The python repl switches from a >>> prompt to a â€¦ prompt inside a block. A blank line terminates the block.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Colons are also used to separate keys from values in dictionary literals and in sequence slice notation.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ruby:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Curly brackets {} delimit blocks. A matched curly bracket pair can be replaced by the do and end keywords. By convention curly brackets are used for one line blocks.,,,,,,

statement separator,,,,,,
,,,,,,
How the parser determines the end of a statement.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
php:,,,,,,

"Variables do not need to be declared and there is no syntax for declaring a local variable. If a variable with no previous reference is accessed, its value is NULL.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
python:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"A variable is created by assignment if one does not already exist. If the variable is inside a function or method, then its scope is the body of the function or method. Otherwise it is a global.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
ruby:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Variables are created by assignment. If the variable does not have a dollar sign ($) or ampersand (@) as its first character then its scope is scope defining region which most immediately contains it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,

Regular Expressions,,,,,,
PHP PCRE Regexes,,,,,,
"Python re library: 2.7, 3.1",,,,,,
Ruby Regexp,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Regular expressions or regexes are a way of specifying sets of strings. If a string belongs to the set, the string and regex ""match"". Regexes can also be used to parse strings.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
The modern notation for regexes was introduced by Unix command line tools in the 1970s. POSIX standardized the notation into two types: extended regexes and the more archaic basic regexes. Perl regexes are extended regexes augmented by new character class abbreviations and a few other features introduced by the Perl interpreter in the 1990s. All the languages in this sheet use Perl regexes.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Any string that doesn't contain regex metacharacters is a regex which matches itself. The regex metacharacters are: [ ] . | ( ) * + ? { } ^ $ \,,,,,,
,,,,,,
character classes: [ ] .,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A character class is a set of characters in brackets: [ ]. When used in a regex it matches any character it contains.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Character classes have their own set of metacharacters: ^ - \ ],,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The ^ is only special when it is the first character in the character class. Such a character class matches its complement; that is, any character not inside the brackets. When not the first character the ^ refers to itself.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
The hyphen is used to specify character ranges: e.g. 0-9 or A-Z. When the hyphen is first or last inside the brackets it matches itself.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The backslash can be used to escape the above characters or the terminal character class delimiter: ]. It can be used in character class abbreviations or string backslash escapes.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The period . is a character class abbreviation which matches any character except for newline. In all languages the period can be made to match all characters. PHP uses the m modifier. Python uses the re.M flag. Ruby uses the s modifier.,,,,,,

A data type which combines both date and time information is convenient, but ISO 8601 doesn't provide a name for such an entity. PHP, Python, and C# use the compound noun datetime for combined date and time values and we adopt it here as a generic term.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"An useful property of ISO 8601 dates, times, and datetimes is that they are correctly ordered by a lexical sort on their string representations. This is because they are big-endian (the year is the leftmost element) and they used fixed-length, zero-padded fields with numerical values for each term in the string representation.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The C standard library provides two methods for representing dates. The first is the Unix epoch, which is the seconds since the beginning of January 1, 1970 in UTC. If such a time were stored in a 32-bit signed integer, the rollover would happen on January 18, 2038. The Unix epoch is an example of a serial datetime, in which the value is stored as a single numeric value representing the difference in time in some unit from a specially designated datetime called the epoch.",,,,,,

In Python 3 print is a function instead of a keyword; parens are mandatory around the argument.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ruby:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Ruby parens are optional. Leaving out the parens results in ambiguity when function invocations are nested.

"The splat operator * collects the remaining arguments into a list. In a function invocation, the splat can be used to expand an array into separate arguments.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The double splat operator ** collects named parameters into a dictionary. In a function invocation, the double splat expands a dictionary into named parameters.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
A double splat operator can be used to force the caller to use named parameter syntax. This method has the disadvantage that spelling errors in the parameter name are not caught:,,,,,,

"Python lambdas cannot contain newlines or semicolons, and thus are limited to a single statement or expression. Unlike named functions, the value of the last statement or expression is returned, and a return is not necessary or permitted. Lambdas are closures and can refer to local variables in scope, even if they are returned from that scope.",,,,,,

"With respect to control words, Proc objects behave like blocks and lambdas like functions. In particular, when the body of a Proc object contains a return or break statement, it acts like a return or break in the code which invoked the Proc object. A return in a lambda merely causes the lambda to exit, and a break inside a lambda must be inside an appropriate control structure contained with the lambda body.",,,,,,

A decorator replaces an invocation of one function with another in a way that that is imperceptible to the client.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Normally a decorator will add a small amount of functionality to the original function which it invokes. A decorator can modify the arguments before passing them to the original function or modify the return value before returning it to the client. Or it can leave the arguments and return value unmodified but perform a side effect such as logging the call.,,,,,,

How to call an operator using the function invocation syntax.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
This is useful when dealing with an API which accepts a function as an argument.,,,,,,

"Ruby has a throw keyword in addition to raise. throw can have a symbol as an argument, and will not convert a string to a RuntimeError exception.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
catch-all handler,,,,,,
,,,,,,
How to catch exceptions.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
php:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
PHP code must specify a variable name for the caught exception. Exception is the top of the exception hierarchy and will catch all exceptions.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Internal PHP functions usually do not throw exceptions. They can be converted to exceptions with this signal handler:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"function exception_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline ) {",,,,,,
"throw new ErrorException($errstr, 0, $errno, $errfile, $errline);",,,,,,
},,,,,,
"set_error_handler(""exception_error_handler"");",,,,,,
,,,,,,
ruby:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A rescue Exception clause will catch any exception. A rescue clause with no exception type specified will catch exceptions that are subclasses of StandardError. Exceptions outside StandardError are usually unrecoverable and hence not handled in code.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"In a rescue clause, the retry keyword will cause the begin clause to be re-executed.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"In addition to begin and rescue, ruby has catch:",,,,,,
,,,,,,
catch (:done) do,,,,,,
loop do,,,,,,
retval = work,,,,,,
throw :done if retval < 10,,,,,,
end,,,,,,
end,,,,,,

,,,,,,
How to re-raise an exception preserving the original stack trace.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
python:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"If the exception is assigned to a variable in the except clause and the variable is used as the argument to raise, then a new stack trace is created.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
ruby:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"If the exception is assigned to a variable in the rescue clause and the variable is used as the argument to raise, then the original stack trace is preserved.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
global variable for last exception,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The global variable name for the last exception raised.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
define exception,,,,,,
,,,,,,
How to define a new variable class.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
handle exception,,,,,,
,,,,,,
How to catch exceptions of a specific type and assign the exception a name.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
php:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
PHP exceptions when caught must always be assigned a variable name.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
finally block,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A block of statements that is guaranteed to be executed even if an exception is thrown or caught.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Threads,,,,,,

,,,,,,
How to read a line from standard input.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The illustrated function read the standard input stream until a end-of-line marker is found or the end of the stream is encountered. Only in the former case will the returned string be terminated by an end-of-line marker.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
php:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"fgets takes an optional second parameter to specify the maximum line length. If the length limit is encountered before a newline, the string returned will not be newline terminated.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
ruby:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"gets takes an optional parameter to specify the maximum line length. If the length limit is encountered before a newline, the string returned will not be newline terminated.",,,,,,

$stdin,STDIN,,,,,
$stdout,STDOUT,,,,,
$stderr,STDERR,,,,,
,,,,,,
remove end-of-line,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Remove a newline, carriage return, or carriage return newline pair from the end of a line if there is one.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
php:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
chop removes all trailing whitespace. It is an alias for rtrim.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
python:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Python strings are immutable. rstrip returns a modified copy of the string. rstrip('\r\n') is not identical to chomp because it removes all contiguous carriage returns and newlines at the end of the string.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ruby:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
chomp! modifies the string in place. chomp returns a modified copy.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
write to stdout,,,,,,
,,,,,,
How to write a line to standard out. The line will be terminated by an operating system appropriate end of line marker.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
python:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"print appends a newline to the output. To suppress this behavior, put a trailing comma after the last argument. If given multiple arguments, print joins them with spaces.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
In Python 2 print parses as a keyword and parentheses are not required:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"print ""Hello, World!""",,,,,,
,,,,,,
ruby:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
puts appends a newline to the output. print does not.,,,,,,

How to put the lines of a file into an array of strings.,,,,,,
read fixed length,,,,,,
How to read up to a pre-specified number of bytes or characters from a file.,,,,,,
node:,,,,,,
Node allows reading a pre-specified max number of bytes. It is possible that the last byte can be an incomplete part of a character. buf.toString('utf-8') returns a malformed string with an incomplete character at the end.,,,,,,
"readSync() returns the number of bytes read. If this is less than the length of the buffer, then the remaining bytes are not overwritten.",,,,,,
Buffer.alloc can take an optional 2nd arg to indicate the fill byte value; the bytes are zero-filled by default.,,,,,,

How to write a string to a file handle.,,,,,,
write line,,,,,,
How to write a line to a file handle. An operating system appropriate end-of-line marker is appended to the output.,,,,,,
**php:,,,,,,
Newlines in strings are translated to the operating system appropriate line terminator unless the file handle was opened with a mode string that contained 'b'.,,,,,,
python:,,,,,,
"When file handles are opened with the mode strings 'r', 'w', or 'a', the file handle is in text mode. In text mode the operating system line terminator is translated to '\n' when reading and '\n' is translated back to the operating system line terminator when writing. The standard file handles sys.stdin, sys.stdout, and sys.stderr are opened in text mode.",,,,,,

ruby:,,,,,,
"File handles are closed when the variable holding them is garbage collected, but there is no guarantee when or if a variable will be garbage collected.",,,,,,
flush,,,,,,
How to flush a file handle that has been written to.,,,,,,
"File handles often have buffering built into them. A buffer collects the result of multiple writes and the data is later written to disk with a single system call write. A flush ensures that the data is on disk, or at least in the operating system disk cache, so that other processes can see it.",,,,,,
position,,,,,,
How to get or set the file handle seek point.,,,,,,
The seek point is where the next read on the file handle will begin. The seek point is measured in bytes starting from zero.,,,,,,
open temporary file,,,,,,
How to get a file handle to a file that will be removed automatically sometime between when the file handle is closed and the interpreter exits.,,,,,,
The file is guaranteed not to have existed before it was opened.,,,,,,
The file handle is opened for both reading and writing so that the information written to the file can be recovered by seeking to the beginning of the file and reading from the file handle.,,,,,,
On POSIX operating systems it is possible to unlink a file after opening it. The file is removed from the directory but continues to exist as long as the file handle is open. This guarantees that no other process will be able to read or modify the file contents.,,,,,,
php:,,,,,,
Here is how to create a temporary file with a name:,,,,,,
"$path = tempnam(sys_get_temp_dir(), """");",,,,,,
"$f = fopen($path, ""w+"");",,,,,,

Option Parsing,,,,,,
,,,,,,
How to process command line options.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
We describe the style used by getopt_long from the C standard library. The characteristics of this style are:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Options can be short or long. Short options are a single character preceded by a hyphen. Long options are a word preceded by two hyphens.,,,,,,
A double hyphen by itself can be used to terminate option processing. Arguments after the double hyphen are treated as positional arguments and can start with a hyphen.,,,,,,
Options can be declared to be with or without argument. Options without argument are used to set a boolean value to true.,,,,,,
Short options without argument can share a hyphen.,,,,,,
"Long options can be separated from their argument by a space or an equals sign (=). Short options can be separated from their argument by nothing, a space, or an equals sign (=).",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The option processing function should identify the positional arguments. These are the command line arguments which are not options, option arguments, or the double hyphen used to terminate option processing. getopt_long permits options to occur after positional arguments.",,,,,,

Objects,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"An object is a set of functions called methods which have shared access to the object's instance variables. An object's methods and instance variables are collectively called its members. If a member of an object can be accessed or invoked by code which is not in a member of the object, it is public. Otherwise it is private.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"A class is a set of objects which have the same method definitions. The objects in the set are instances of the class. Functions defined in the class namespace which are not object methods are called class methods. A class method which returns instances of the class is called a factory method. If there is class method which is responsible for creating all instances, it is called a constructor. The existence of a constructor does not preclude the existence of other factory methods since they can invoke the constructor and return its return value.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
A class may contain class variables. These are global variables defined in the namespace of the class.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A method which returns the value of an instance variable is called a getter. A method which sets the value of an instance variable is called a setter. Getters and setters and seem pointless at first blush as one could make the underlying instance variable public instead. In practice getters and setters make code more maintainable. Consistent use of getters and setters conforms with the Uniform Access Principle and makes the API presented by an object to its clients simpler.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Perl instance variables are private, so Perl enforces a good practice at the cost of requiring boilerplate code for defining getters and setters.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Python instance variables are public. Although this permits concise class definitions, a maintainer of a Python class may find it difficult to replace an instance variable with a derived value when clients are accessing the instance variable directly. With an old-style Python class, the maintainer can't make the change without breaking the client code. With a new-style class the maintainer can replace an instance variable with a getter and setter and mark them with the @property decorator.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Ruby, like Perl, has private instance variables. It has the directives attr_reader, attr_writer, and attr_accessor for defining getters and setters. Ruby classes are objects and in particular they are instances of the Module class. The directives attr_reader, attr_writer, and attr_accessor are instance methods defined in the Module class which execute when the class block executes.",,,,,,

"As of Python 2.2, classes are of two types: new-style classes and old-style classes. The class type is determined by the type of class(es) the class inherits from. If no superclasses are specified, then the class is old-style. As of Python 3.0, all classes are new-style.",,,,,,

"Ruby lacks a destructor. It is possible to register a block to be executed before the memory for an object is released by the garbage collector. A ruby interpreter may exit without releasing memory for objects that have gone out of scope and in this case the finalizer will not get called. Furthermore, if the finalizer block holds on to a reference to the object, it will prevent the garbage collector from freeing the object.",,,,,,

By contrast, __getattribute__, which is only available in Python 3, is always invoked, and can be used to intercept access to attributes that exist. __setattr__ and __delattr__ are invoked when attempting to set or delete attributes that don't exist.

How to create an alias for a method.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ruby:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Ruby provides the keyword alias and the method alias_method in the class Module. Inside a class body they behave idenitically. When called from inside a method alias has no effect but alias_method works as expected. Hence some recommend always using alias_method.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
subclass,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A subclass is a class whose objects contain all of the methods from another class called the superclass. Objects in the subclass should in principle be usable anywhere objects in the superclass can be used. The subclass may have extra methods which are not found in the superclass. Moreover it may replace method definitions in the superclass with its own definitions provided the signature remains the same. This is called overriding.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
It is sometimes useful to define superclass which is never instantiated. Such a class is called an abstract class. An abstract class is way to share code between two or more subclasses or to define the API that two or more subclasses should implement.,,,,,,
