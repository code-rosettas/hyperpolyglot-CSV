,The modern notation for regexes was introduced by Unix command line tools in the 1970s. POSIX standardized the notation into two types: extended regexes and the more archaic basic regexes. Perl regexes are extended regexes augmented by new character class abbreviations and a few other features introduced by the Perl interpreter in the 1990s.

,Character classes have their own set of metacharacters: ^ - \ ],,,,
,,,,,
,"The ^ is only special when it is the first character in the character class. Such a character class matches its complement; that is, any character not inside the brackets. When not the first character the ^ refers to itself.",,,,
,,,,,
,The hyphen is used to specify character ranges: e.g. 0-9 or A-Z. When the hyphen is first or last inside the brackets it matches itself.,,,,
,,,,,
,The backslash can be used to escape the above characters or the terminal character class delimiter: ]. It can be used in character class abbreviations or string backslash escapes.,,,,
,,,,,
,The period . is a character class abbreviation which matches any character except for newline. In all languages the period can be made to match all characters. PHP uses the m modifier. Python uses the re.M flag. Ruby uses the s modifier.,,,,

,"An useful property of ISO 8601 dates, times, and datetimes is that they are correctly ordered by a lexical sort on their string representations. This is because they are big-endian (the year is the leftmost element) and they used fixed-length, zero-padded fields with numerical values for each term in the string representation.",,,,
,,,,,
,"The C standard library provides two methods for representing dates. The first is the Unix epoch, which is the seconds since the beginning of January 1, 1970 in UTC. If such a time were stored in a 32-bit signed integer, the rollover would happen on January 18, 2038. The Unix epoch is an example of a serial datetime, in which the value is stored as a single numeric value representing the difference in time in some unit from a specially designated datetime called the epoch.",,,,

,"Another serial datetime is the Windows file time, which is the number of 100 nanosecond intervals since the beginning of January 1, 1601 UTC. It was introduced when journaling was added to NTFS as part of the Windows 2000 launch.",,,,

,The syntax for an anonymous function literal; i.e. a lambda function.,,,,
,,,,,
,python:,,,,
,,,,,
,"Python lambdas cannot contain newlines or semicolons, and thus are limited to a single statement or expression. Unlike named functions, the value of the last statement or expression is returned, and a return is not necessary or permitted. Lambdas are closures and can refer to local variables in scope, even if they are returned from that scope.",,,,

,,,,,
,"With respect to control words, Proc objects behave like blocks and lambdas like functions. In particular, when the body of a Proc object contains a return or break statement, it acts like a return or break in the code which invoked the Proc object. A return in a lambda merely causes the lambda to exit, and a break inside a lambda must be inside an appropriate control structure contained with the lambda body.",,,,

,How to create a first class function with access to the local variables of the local scope in which it was created.,,,,
,,,,,
,python:,,,,

,decorator,,,,
,,,,,
,A decorator replaces an invocation of one function with another in a way that that is imperceptible to the client.,,,,
,,,,,
,Normally a decorator will add a small amount of functionality to the original function which it invokes. A decorator can modify the arguments before passing them to the original function or modify the return value before returning it to the client. Or it can leave the arguments and return value unmodified but perform a side effect such as logging the call.,,,,

,,,,,
,How to call an operator using the function invocation syntax.,,,,
,,,,,
,This is useful when dealing with an API which accepts a function as an argument.,,,,
